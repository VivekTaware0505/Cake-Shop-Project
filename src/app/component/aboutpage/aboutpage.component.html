        Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients and is usually baked. In their oldest
        forms,
        cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or
        elaborate and
        which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.

        The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil, or margarine), a liquid, and a
        leavening agent,
        such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit,
        nuts, cocoa, and extracts
        such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit
        preserves, nuts, or
        dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream, or syrups),[1] iced with buttercream or other
        icings, and decorated
        with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.

        Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and
        birthdays.
        There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old.
        Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making
        (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even
        the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake

        During the Great Depression, there was a surplus of molasses and the need to provide easily made food to
        millions of economically depressed people in the United States.[8] One company patented a cake-bread mix
        to deal with this economic situation and thereby established the first line of cake in a box. In doing so,
        cake, as it is known today, became a mass-produced good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty.

        Later, during the post-war boom, other American companies (notably General Mills) developed this idea further,
        marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience, especially to housewives. When sales dropped heavily in the
        1950s,
        marketers discovered that baking cakes, once a task at which housewives could exercise skill and creativity, had
        become
        dispiriting. This was a period in American ideological history when women, retired from the war-time labor
        force, were
        confined to the domestic sphere while still exposed to the blossoming consumerism in the US.[9] This inspired
        psychologist Ernest Dichter to find a solution to the cake mix problem in the frosting.[10] Since making the
        cake was so simple, housewives and other in-home cake makers could expend their creative energy on cake
        decorating inspired by, among other things, photographs in magazines of elaborately decorated cakes.
