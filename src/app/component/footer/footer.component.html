    confined to the domestic sphere while still exposed to the blossoming consumerism in the US.[9] This inspired
    psychologist Ernest Dichter to find a solution to the cake mix problem in the frosting.[10] Since making the

    The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil, or margarine), a liquid, and a
    leavening agent,
    such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit,
    nuts, cocoa, and extracts
    such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit
    preserves, nuts, or
    dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream, or syrups),[1] iced with buttercream or other
    icings, and decorated
    with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.

    Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and
    birthdays.
    There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old.
    Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making
    (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even
    the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake
